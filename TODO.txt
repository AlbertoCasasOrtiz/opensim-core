Integrate into opensim-core?

For:

- more exposure to users; easier for users to obtain the software.
- easier conceptually for users: not so many different pieces.
- easier to maintain fewer separate projects
- unified documentation
- easier to build matlab/python bindings.


Against:

- must pass thorough review.
- increases opensim-core build time
- adds many dependencies to opensim-core.
