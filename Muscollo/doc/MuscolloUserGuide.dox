OpenSim Muscollo is a software package for solving optimal control problems for
musculoskeletal systems modeled in OpenSim.
The package has Python, MATLAB, and XML (command-line) interfaces; the core
library is written in C++. Here are some problems you can solve with Muscollo:

1. Solve for the muscle activity that tracks a known motion.
2. Solve for a new motion that optimizes some cost functional.
3. Solve for mass properties that minimize residual "hand of God" forces.

The optimal control problems are solved using the direct collocation method.
Learning about direct collocation is beyond the scope of this documentation. See
the following references:

  - TODO Matt Kelly's paper.

Muscollo can solve specific classes of problems, such as tracking, TODO, and
also has a generic interface for solving custom optimal control problems.

@note Solving a custom optimal control problem with direct collocation is not
easy, and requires significant tuning of the direct collocation method's
settings. Use the more specific interfaces if possible; and only create a custom
problem as a last resort.

@section Example

TODO

The interface to Muscollo starts with the MucoTool. The MucoTool contains a
MucoProblem and a MucoSolver.

  - MucoProblem: describes the variables, dynamics, constraints, and cost
      functional of the optimal control problem.
  - MucoSolver: solves the MucoProblem using direct collocation.


@section Workflow

When building a MucoTool programmatically (e.g., in C++), the workflow is as
follows:

1. Build the MucoProblem (set the model, constraints, etc.).
2. Call MucoTool::initSolver(), which returns a reference to the MucoSolver.
3. Edit the settings of the MucoSolver (returned by initSolver()).
4. Call MucoTool::solve(). This returns the MucoSolution.
5. (Optional) Postprocess the solution, perhaps using MucoTool::visualize().

After calling solve(), you can edit the MucoProblem and/or the MucoSolver.
You can then edit the problem or solver and call solve() again, if you wish.


@section MucoProblem

A MucoProblem contains multiple phases.

TODO describe bounds (set automatically based on the model).

    ///     The bounds on this state variable over the entire phase. If
    ///     default-constructed (`{}`), and the state is *not* a coordinate
    ///     value, then no bounds are applied. If default-constructed, the state
    ///     *is* a coordinate value and the coordinate's **clamped** property is
    ///     true, then the bounds are set to the coordinate's **range** (see
    ///     Coordinate::clamped and Coordinate::range). (TODO)

See @ref mucocost for more information.

@section MucoSolver

A MucoSolver attempts to use an optimal control method to solve the MucoProblem,
and exposes the settings that you can use to

@subsection MucoTropterSolver

@par Dynamics mode: implicit

When using the implicit dynamics mode, the differential equations for multibody
dynamics are expressed as implicit differential equations. That is, they are
in the form \f$ 0 = f(x, \dot{x}) \f$ rather than \f$ \dot{x} = f(x) \f$.

The following are not currently supported with implicit dynamics:

1. Auxiliary dynamics (e.g., activation and fiber dynamics).
2. Acceleration-level quantities (e.g., MucoJointReactionNormCost).
3. Multibody constraints.


@section tips Tips for solving a custom problem

1. Make sure every variable has bounds.
