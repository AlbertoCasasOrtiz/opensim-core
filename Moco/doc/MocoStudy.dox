MocoStudy allows one to solve a generic optimal control problem, where the
costs, constraints, and solver settings are fully defined by the user. That is,
we solve the following problem:

\f[
    \begin{alignat*}{2}
		\mbox{minimize} \quad & \sum_j w_{E,j} \left(J_{E,j}(t_0, t_f, y_0, y_f, x_{0}, x_{f}, \lambda_0, \lambda_f, p)
		 + \int_{t_0}^{t_f} J_{I,j}(t, y, x, \lambda, p)~dt\right) &&  \\
		\mbox{subject to} \quad & \dot{q} = u \\
		 & M(q, p)\dot{u} + G(q, p)^T \lambda = f_{\textrm{app}}(t, y, x, p) - f_{\textrm{bias}}(q, u, p) \\
		 & \dot{z}(t) = f_{\textrm{aux}}(t, y, x, \lambda, p) \\
		 & 0 = \phi(q, p) \\
		 & 0 = \nu(q, u, p) \\
		 & 0 = \alpha(q, u, \dot{u}, p) \\
		 & g_{L} \leq g(t, y, x, \lambda, p) \leq g_{U} \\

		 & t_{0,L} \leq t_0 \leq t_{0,U} \\
		 & t_{f,L} \leq t_f \leq t_{f,U}
	\end{alignat*}
\f]

We use the following notation:

- \f$ t \f$: time
- \f$ q(t) \f$: generalized coordinates
- \f$ u(t) \f$: generalized speeds
- \f$ z(t) \f$: auxiliary states (muscle fiber length and activation)
- \f$ y(t) = (q(t), u(t), z(t))\f$
- \f$ x(t) \f$: controls (including muscle activation)
- \f$ p \f$: constant parameters
- \f$ \lambda \f$: kinematic constraint multipliers
- \f$ w_j \f$: weight for \f$ j \f$-th cost
- \f$ J_{E,j} \f$: endpoint portion of the \f$ j \f$-th cost
- \f$ J_{I,j} \f$: integrand portion of the \f$ j \f$-th cost
- \f$ M \f$: mass matrix
- \f$ f_{\textrm{bias}} \f$: centripetal and coriolis forces
- \f$ G \f$: kinematic constraint Jacobian
- \f$ f_{\textrm{app}} \f$: applied forces (gravity, muscles, etc.)
- \f$ f_{\textrm{aux}} \f$: auxiliary dynamics (muscle activation dynamics, etc.)
- \f$ \phi \f$: position-level (holonomic) kinematic constraints
- \f$ \nu \f$: velocity-level (non-holonomic) kinematic constraints
- \f$ \alpha \f$: acceleration-level constraints

@section Overview

A MocoStudy contains a MocoProblem and a MocoSolver.

  - MocoProblem: describes the variables, dynamics, constraints, and cost
      functional of the optimal control problem, using an OpenSim model.
  - MocoSolver: solves the MocoProblem using direct collocation.

When building a MocoStudy programmatically (e.g., in C++), the workflow is as
follows:

1. Build the MocoProblem (set the model, constraints, etc.).
2. Call MocoStudy::initTropterSolver() (or MocoStudy::initCasADiSolver()), which
   returns a reference to a MocoSolver.
3. Edit the settings of the MocoSolver.
4. Call MocoStudy::solve(). This returns the MocoSolution.
5. (Optional) Postprocess the solution, perhaps using MocoStudy::visualize().

After calling MocoStudy::solve(), you can edit the MocoProblem and/or the
MocoSolver and call MocoStudy::solve() again, if you wish.

@section MocoProblem

A MocoProblem is a list of MocoPhase%s, but Moco currently supports only
single-phase problems. A MocoPhase consists of the following:

1. an OpenSim model that describe states, controls, dynamics, and kinematic
   constraints.
2. MocoCost%s: describes the cost functional to minimize.
3. MocoPathConstraint%s: describes non-kinematic algebraic constraints to
   enforce over the entire phase.
4. MocoParameter%s: describes Model (time-invariant) properties to optimize.
5. Bounds on initial and final time.
6. Bounds (initial, final, and over all time) for state variables, stored in
   MocoVariableInfo.
7. Bounds (initial, final, and over all time) for control variables, stored in
   MocoVariableInfo.

@subsection Bounds

@subsubsection Time

By default, the initial time and final time are unconstrained. However, this is
rarely what you want, and often causes a problem to behave poorly. Moco issues a
warning if you do not set bounds for initial or final time.

@subsubsection Defaults

Setting bounds for state and control variables is an important but often arduous
process. To help, Moco sets some variable bounds automatically. See
MocoPhase::setStateInfo() and MocoPhase::setControlInfo() for details.

Although we support setting initial and final bounds for controls, such
functionality is not too useful: the initial and final values of a control have
little influence on the value of the control at nearby times.

See @ref mococost for more information.

@section MocoSolver

A MocoSolver attempts to use an optimal control method to solve the MocoProblem,
and exposes the settings that you can use to TODO.

where \f$ w \f$ is generalized acceleration and \f$ w_B \f$ is a large number.

@subsection MocoTropterSolver

@par Dynamics mode: implicit

When using the implicit dynamics mode, the differential equations for multibody
dynamics are expressed as implicit differential equations. That is, they are
in the form \f$ 0 = f(x, \dot{x}) \f$ rather than \f$ \dot{x} = f(x) \f$.

The following are not currently supported with implicit dynamics:

1. Auxiliary dynamics (e.g., activation and fiber dynamics).
2. Acceleration-level quantities (e.g., MocoJointReactionNormCost).
3. Kinematic constraints.


@subsection kincon Kinematic constraints

Moco supports enforcing OpenSim kinematic constraints in optimal control
problems. When the MocoTropterSolver is initialized, any kinematic constraints
enabled in the model are automatically detected, and additional information
about each constraint is stored. This information includes the number of scalar
path constraints (including derivatives if they exist), the scalar constraint
kinematic levels (i.e. holonomic, non-holonomic, or acceleration), and the
number of Lagrange multipliers that are added to the problem to enforce the
constraints.

MocoTropterSolver has options if the user desires to enforce kinematic
constraint derivatives or minimize Lagrange multipliers in the problem.

\code{.cpp}
MocoTropterSolver& solver = moco.initTropterSolver();
ms.set_enforce_constraint_derivatives(true);
ms.set_lagrange_multiplier_weight(10);
\endcode

If constraint derivatives are enforced, velocity correction variables are added
to the problem according to the method described in Posa, Kuindersma, and
Tedrake, 2016, "Optimization and stabilization of trajectories for constrained
dynamical systems." It is also possible to modify the default bounds on these
velocity correction variables:

\code{.cpp}
// Default bounds: [-0.1, 0.1]
ms.set_velocity_correction_bounds({-0.25, 0.25});
\endcode

If constraint derivatives are not enforced or if the multibody constraint
Jacobian is rank-deficient, it is recommended that the Lagrange multiplier
minimization term is added to the problem to provide impose uniqueness for
these variables.

@section prescribedmotion Prescribed motion

A common goal in musculoskeletal biomechanics is to estimate for muscle and
actuator behavior that drove an observed motion. We can solve this
problem by tracking the observed motion, as with Computed Muscle Control (using
the "slow target") or MocoTrack. Alternatively, we can prescribe the motion
exactly, as with Static Optimization, EMG-driven simulation [TODO cite
Arnold2013, Jackson2016, etc.], and the Muscle Redundancy Solver
[DeGroote2016]. The advantage of prescribing the motion is the problem is more
robust and solves faster, as the nonlinear multibody dynamics are no longer
part of the optimization problem. The disadvantage is that we cannot predict
deviations from the observed motion.

OpenSim supports prescribed motion in two ways. The first is by adding a
position-level constraint to the system, as is done by Coordinate's `prescribed`
and `prescribed_function` properties. A more efficient way is to remove degrees
of freedom from the system (using SimTK::Motion). Moco supports this
"reduce-DOF" formulation, which results in the following optimal control problem.

\f[
    \begin{alignat*}{2}
		\mbox{minimize} \quad & \sum_j w_{E,j} \left(J_{E,j}(t_0, t_f, \hat{q}_0, \hat{q}_f, \hat{u}_0, \hat{u}_f, z_0, z_f, x_{0}, x_{f}, \lambda_0, \lambda_f, p)
		 + \int_{t_0}^{t_f} J_{I,j}(t, \hat{q}, \hat{u}, z, x, \lambda, p)~dt\right) &&  \\
		\mbox{subject to} \quad &
		 M(\hat{q}, p)\dot{\hat{u}} + G(\hat{q}, p)^T \lambda = f_{\textrm{app}}(t, \hat{q}, \hat{u}, z, x, p) - f_{\textrm{bias}}(\hat{q}, \hat{u}, p) \\
		 & \dot{z}(t) = f_{\textrm{aux}}(t, \hat{q}, \hat{u}, x, \lambda, p) \\
		 & g_{L} \leq g(t, \hat{q}, \hat{u}, z, x, \lambda, p) \leq g_{U} \\
		 & z_{0,L} \leq z_0 \leq z_{0,U} \\
		 & x_{0,L} \leq x_{0} \leq x_{0,U} \\
		 & z_{L} \leq z \leq z_{U} \\
		 & x_{L} \leq x \leq x_{U} \\
		 & z_{f,L} \leq z_f \leq z_{f,U} \\
		 & x_{f,L} \leq x_{f} \leq x_{f,U} \\
		 & p_{L} \leq p \leq p_{U} \\
		 & t_{0,L} \leq t_0 \leq t_{0,U} \\
		 & t_{f,L} \leq t_f \leq t_{f,U}
	\end{alignat*}
\f]

In this formulation, the kinematic variables \f$ q \f$ and \f$ u \f$ are
replaced with known quantities \f$ \hat{q} \f$ and \f$ \hat{u} \f$. The system
still contains auxiliary state variables \f$ z \f$, and control variables \f$ x
\f$, and auxiliary dynamics. If none of the parameter variables affect the
multibody system, then the multibody dynamics is reduced to a force balance:
applied forces must match the net generalized forces determined by the
kinematics (that is, inverse dynamics).

To prescribe motion in the "reduce-DOF" way, add a PositionMotion component
to your model. PositionMotion requires that all DOFs are prescribed; we do not
support prescribing a subset of the degrees of freedom.

If a model contains kinematic constraints, you must ensure that the
prescribed motion obeys the kinematic constraints. PositionMotion does not
ensure this for you. Otherwise, your answers will be nonphysical. TODO
MocoInverse assembles. Even though the kinematic constraint equations no longer
appear, we must still include constraint forces \f$ G^T \lambda \f$, as the
applied forces affect what the constraint forces must be. Consider a point mass
welded in place: the constraint forces must counter any applied forces to
maintain the weld constraint.
