@section faqcustomgoal How do I define a custom goal or cost term?

If Moco does not contain a cost term you need, you can create your own in C++ by
deriving from the MocoGoal class. If you do not want to use C++, you can draft
your goal in Matlab, send us your Matlab code, and we will consider implementing
it in C++ for you. See @ref customgoal for more information.

@section faqinterrupt How do I interrupt an optimization in MATLAB?

Sometimes, you may want to interrupt an optimization before it is complete. In
MATLAB, we commonly use Ctrl-C to interrupt code, but this does not work during
a Moco optimization.

Use this alternative: During an optimization, Moco tries to write a text file to
your current directory named "delete_this...". Delete this file to interrupt the
optimization.
