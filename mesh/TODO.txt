Create Eigen-like wrapper for ADOL-C and its drivers, so that I am passing
around Vectors, not C-style arrays.

Move ADOL-C code from IpoptSolver::TNLP to OptimizationProblem<adouble>.

Trying non-virtual interface for OptimizationProblem, but a Proxy class could
 be preferable.

 For finite diff version (with doubles), make SURE to use Map<Matrix> to
 avoid copying the variables (x). For adouble, it's fine and necessary (for
 the autodiff conversion), but is NOT necessary for doubles.

 TODO still allow users to specify their own derivatives even if using doubles?
